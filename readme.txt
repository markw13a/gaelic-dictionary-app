TODO:
1) Add ability to change between views by swiping left or right 

2) Add "search history"? May or may not do.

3) Integrate Gaelic definitions dictionary

4) Seek out more complete primary dictionary database

5) Finish work on changes to DB. Favourited now records timestamp representing when item was favourited. Need to alter search results to give union of actual DB results and results from user created items table.

May now be problems with distinguishing between db results and user created results.
