TODO:
1) Add ability to change between views by swiping left or right 

2) Seek out more complete primary dictionary database

3) Look in to main search query not being able to find user created terms when Gaelic is used. Probably something to do with table structure of original data.

4) Have saved items list refresh after user adds or deletes a term

5) Rework UI
