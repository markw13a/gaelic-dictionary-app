TODO:
1) Clean underlying DB data
  -> Remove HTML artifacts (<i></i> tags and others)
  -> Change how English definitions are stored. Would rather this were returned as an array rather than a single string
  
2) Change fuzzy matching algorithm. Full-text search generally means that you have to type out a full work before getting the definition. Also has trouble with hyphenated words (quite a big issue for a Gaelic dictionary).

3) Add ability to change between views by swiping left or right 

4) Reduce tech debt around styles

5) Create nicer icon
