TODO:
1) Add ability to change between views by swiping left or right 

2) Add "search history"? May or may not do.

3) Integrate Gaelic definitions dictionary

4) Seek out more complete primary dictionary database

5) Fix bug where add word fields do not clear themselves after user has added a new word (thought that this might happen).
